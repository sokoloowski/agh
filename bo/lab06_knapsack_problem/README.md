# Lab 06 - Knapsack Problem

The goal of this is lab is to implement various solvers for the knapsack problem.
One has to: fill missing code in: 
  * `saport.knapsack.solvers.greedy`
  * `saport.knapsack.solvers.greedy_density`
  * `saport.knapsack.solvers.greedy_value`
  * `saport.knaspack.solvers.greedy_weight`
  * `saport.knapsack.solvers.dynamic`
  * `saport.knaspack.solvers.bnb`
  * `saport.knapsack.solvers.bnb_dfs`
  
The `saport.knaspack.solvers.dfs` is already implemented, you may use the `benchmarks.py` 
to compare your implementations. 
Choose solvers in `benchmark.py` to benchmark particular algorithms.
