# Lab 05 - Critical Path

The goal of this is lab is to implement a critical path algorithm.
On has also to build two simplex models finding the critical path duration.

TODO:
* fill missing code in: 
  * `saport.critical_path.solvers.simplex_solver_min.py`
  * `saport.critical_path.solvers.simplex_solver_max.py`
  * `saport.critical_path.solvers.cpm_solver.py`
* run `test.py` to test your code on all available instances

## SAPORT

SAPORT = Student's Attempt to Produce an Operation Research Toolkit

Includes:

* two-step simplex
* critical-path problem
